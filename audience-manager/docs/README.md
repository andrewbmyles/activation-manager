### Phase 2: Core Development (Weeks 2-4)
1. **State Management** - Implement patterns from [State Management](./STATE-MANAGEMENT.md)
2. **Component Library** - Build components using [Component Guide](./COMPONENT-DEVELOPMENT-GUIDE.md)
3. **Page Implementation** - Create main application pages
4. **Testing Setup** - Implement testing strategies

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Weeks 5-6)
1. **Variable Metadata System** - Complex dropdown and search functionality
2. **Audience Builder** - Dynamic form with criteria management
3. **Platform Integration** - Logo system and configuration forms
4. **Analytics Dashboard** - Data visualization components

### Phase 4: Production Preparation (Week 7)
1. **Performance Optimization** - Code splitting and bundle analysis
2. **Testing Coverage** - Unit, integration, and e2e tests
3. **Deployment Setup** - CI/CD pipeline and environment configuration
4. **Monitoring** - Error tracking and analytics integration

## Key Implementation Patterns

### Component Architecture
```typescript
// Standard component structure
export const Component = memo(({ prop1, prop2, ...props }: Props) => {
  const [localState, setLocalState] = useState(initialValue);
  const { data, isLoading } = useQuery(['key'], fetchFn);
  
  const handleAction = useCallback(() => {
    // Action logic
  }, [dependencies]);
  
  return (
    <div className="component-styles">
      {/* Component JSX */}
    </div>
  );
});
```

### State Management Pattern
```typescript
// Server state with React Query
export function useAudiences() {
  return useQuery({
    queryKey: ['audiences'],
    queryFn: fetchAudiences,
    staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000,
  });
}

// Local state with custom hooks
export function useAudienceBuilder() {
  const [criteria, dispatch] = useReducer(criteriaReducer, initialState);
  // Additional state logic
  return { criteria, actions };
}
```

### Styling Pattern
```css
/* Component-specific styles using Tailwind */
.audience-card {
  @apply bg-white rounded-lg shadow-sm border border-gray-200 p-6 hover:shadow-md transition-shadow;
}

/* Responsive utilities */
.responsive-grid {
  @apply grid grid-cols-1 gap-4 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3;
}
```

## Development Standards

### Code Quality
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode enabled, no `any` types
- **ESLint**: React hooks rules and accessibility checks
- **Testing**: >80% coverage requirement
- **Performance**: Bundle size <250KB gzipped

### Git Workflow
```bash
# Feature development
git checkout -b feature/audience-type-selection
git commit -m "feat: add audience type selection dropdown

- Implement primary/subtype cascade
- Add form validation
- Update TypeScript interfaces"

# Follow conventional commits for CI/CD
```

### Code Review Checklist
- [ ] TypeScript types properly defined
- [ ] Components follow established patterns
- [ ] State management best practices
- [ ] Accessibility (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- [ ] Performance considerations (memoization, lazy loading)
- [ ] Error handling and loading states
- [ ] Responsive design implementation
- [ ] Test coverage for new functionality

## Technical Decisions and Rationale

### Why React Query?
- **Server State Specialization**: Purpose-built for API data management
- **Caching Strategy**: Intelligent background updates and stale-while-revalidate
- **Developer Experience**: Excellent DevTools and error handling
- **Performance**: Automatic request deduplication and background fetching

### Why Tailwind CSS?
- **Development Speed**: Utility-first approach reduces context switching
- **Consistency**: Design system built into CSS classes
- **Performance**: Purged CSS in production, minimal bundle size
- **Maintainability**: No CSS files to manage, component-level styling

### Why React Hook Form?
- **Performance**: Minimal re-renders with uncontrolled components
- **Developer Experience**: Excellent TypeScript support and validation integration
- **Flexibility**: Works with any UI library and validation schema
- **Bundle Size**: Lightweight compared to alternatives

### Why Create React App?
- **Zero Configuration**: Production-ready build setup out of the box
- **Battle Tested**: Used by thousands of applications in production
- **Tooling Integration**: ESLint, TypeScript, testing setup included
- **Upgrade Path**: Can eject if custom webpack configuration needed
