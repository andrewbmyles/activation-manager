# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click the "+" icon in the top-right corner
3. Select "New repository"
4. Configure your repository:
   - **Repository name**: `activation-manager` (or your preferred name)
   - **Description**: `Audience Management and Distribution Platform`
   - **Visibility**: ✅ **Private** (as requested)
   - **Initialize**: ❌ Do NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)

## Step 2: Initialize Local Git Repository

Open Terminal and navigate to your project directory, then run:

```bash
cd "/Users/myles/Documents/Activation Manager/audience-manager"

# Initialize git repository
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Create initial commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: Activation Manager v1.2.1

✨ Features:

🐛 Fixes:

## Step 3: Connect to GitHub

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` and `REPO_NAME` with your actual GitHub username and repository name:

```bash
# Add GitHub remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 4: Verify Upload

1. Refresh your GitHub repository page
2. You should see all your files uploaded
3. Verify the README.md displays correctly

## Step 5: Connect to Vercel

1. Go to [Vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign in
2. Click "New Project"
3. Import your GitHub repository
4. Vercel will auto-detect it's a React app
5. Use these settings:
   - **Build Command**: `npm run build`
   - **Output Directory**: `build`
   - **Install Command**: `npm install`
6. Click "Deploy"

## Expected Repository Structure

Your GitHub repository will contain:
```
activation-manager/
├── public/
├── src/
├── package.json
├── README.md
├── RELEASE-NOTES.md
├── UPDATE-PROTOCOL.md
├── DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md
├── .gitignore
└── Other configuration files
```

## Deployment URLs

After Vercel deployment, you'll get:
- **Production URL**: `https://your-repo-name.vercel.app`
- **Preview URLs**: For each commit/branch

## Security Notes

- ✅ Repository is set to private
- ✅ No sensitive data in code
- ✅ All API keys are mock/demo values
- ✅ Build files excluded from repository

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check that git is installed: `git --version`
2. Verify GitHub credentials are set up
3. Ensure repository name matches in remote URL
4. Check Vercel build logs for deployment issues

## Next Steps

1. Create the GitHub repository
2. Run the git commands above
3. Connect to Vercel
4. Share the Vercel URL for testing

Your application will be live and accessible worldwide once deployed!
