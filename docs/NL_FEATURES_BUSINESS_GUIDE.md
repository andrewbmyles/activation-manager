## 🛠️ Natural Language Features

### 1. **Smart Variable Search**
Transform natural language into precise variable selections.

**Example Queries:**
- "millennials interested in sustainable products" 
- "high net worth individuals who travel frequently"
- "parents with young children in urban areas"

**What Happens Behind the Scenes:**
```
User Query: "millennials interested in sustainable products"
                            ↓
System Identifies:
- Age concept: millennials → AGE_25_40
- Interest concept: sustainable → ENV_CONSCIOUS, GREEN_SHOPPER
- Product behavior: products → PURCHASE_ECO_FRIENDLY
                            ↓
Returns: Ranked list of matching variables with relevance scores
```

### 2. **Intelligent Query Understanding**

The system understands various ways of expressing the same concept:

| User Says | System Understands |
|-----------|-------------------|
| "high income" | Income $100K+, affluent, wealthy, high net worth |
| "young adults" | Age 18-34, millennials, Gen Z |
| "tech savvy" | Digital natives, online shoppers, early adopters |
| "urban" | City dwellers, metropolitan, downtown residents |

### 3. **Context-Aware Suggestions**

The system provides different results based on context:

**Query: "green"**
- In context of shopping → ECO_FRIENDLY_SHOPPER
- In context of politics → ENVIRONMENTAL_VOTER  
- In context of energy → RENEWABLE_ENERGY_USER

### 4. **Natural Language Audience Builder**

Users can describe their entire audience in one sentence:

**Input:** "I want to find affluent millennials in major cities who are interested in luxury travel and premium brands"

**System Process:**
