# Enhancement: Semantic Variable Picker - 50 Results with Pagination

## What Was Changed

### Backend Changes (main.py)
1. **Increased Results Limit**: Changed from hardcoded 5 results to 50 results
   - Line 367: `all_variables = search_variables(query, 50)`
   
2. **Updated Response Format**: Modified `/api/nl/process` endpoint to match frontend expectations
   - Returns variables grouped by category (demographic, behavioral, psychographic, financial)
   - Each category limited to 15 variables to maintain performance
   - Proper relevance scoring passed through

### Frontend Changes (EnhancedNLAudienceBuilder.tsx)
1. **Added Pagination State**:
   ```typescript
   const [currentPage, setCurrentPage] = useState(1);
   const [variablesPerPage] = useState(10);
   const [showAllVariables, setShowAllVariables] = useState(false);
   ```

2. **Enhanced Variable Display**:
   - Shows 10 variables per page by default
   - Added "Show All" toggle for users who want to see all results at once
   - Display count: "Showing 1-10 of 50"

3. **Pagination Controls**:
   - Previous/Next buttons
   - Page number buttons (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
   - Disabled states for first/last page
   - Clean, accessible UI

4. **Improved Default Selection**:
   - Now pre-selects top 10 variables instead of 7
   - Resets to page 1 when new search is performed

## User Experience Improvements

1. **More Results**: Users now see up to 50 relevant variables instead of just 5
2. **Better Organization**: Results paginated for easier browsing
3. **Flexibility**: Option to view all results or browse page by page
4. **Performance**: Frontend remains responsive even with more results
5. **Clear Feedback**: Shows total count and current range

## Testing the Enhancement

1. Go to Audience Builder
2. Select "Natural Language" mode
3. Enter a query like "millennials with high income in urban areas"
4. Observe:
   - 50 results returned (shown in the message)
   - 10 results displayed per page
   - Pagination controls working
   - "Show All" toggle functioning
   - Variables properly categorized

## Technical Notes

- Backend search uses the existing `search_variables()` function with smart relevance scoring
- Results are grouped by category to maintain the expected data structure
- Each category is limited to 15 variables to prevent any single category from dominating
- Frontend gracefully handles any number of results with dynamic pagination
