# Debug Findings Summary - Similarity Filtering Issue

## Key Discovery

The debug logs reveal that **filtering IS being executed** in staging:
- Log shows: `🔍 _filter_similar_variables called with 50 results`
- Log shows: `Similarity filtering: 50 -> 26 results`
- Log shows: `📊 Enhanced search results: 26 items`

However, the API response still returns 50 results with all "Contact with friends" variations.

## Root Cause Analysis

### What's Happening:
1. ✅ Parameters are passed correctly through all layers
2. ✅ The `_filter_similar_variables` method is called
3. ✅ The method reduces results internally (50 → 26)
4. ❌ But the filtered results are not being returned to the client

### Likely Issue:
There appears to be a disconnect between:
- What the filtering method returns (26 results)
- What the API ultimately sends to the client (50 results)

This suggests one of these scenarios:
1. The filtered results are being overwritten somewhere
2. The wrong variable is being returned in the response
3. There's a caching issue where old results are returned

## Evidence from Logs

```
2025-05-30 18:54:53 - 🔍 Enhanced search request: query='contact with friends income', filter_similar=True
2025-05-30 18:54:53 - ✅ Applying similarity filtering in advanced path to 50 results
2025-05-30 18:54:53 - 🔍 _filter_similar_variables called with 50 results, threshold=0.75
2025-05-30 18:54:53 - Similarity filtering: 50 -> 26 results
2025-05-30 18:54:53 - 📊 Enhanced search results: 26 items
```

## Next Steps to Fix

1. **Check the return path**: Ensure the filtered results are actually being assigned back to the response
2. **Add more logging**: Log the exact results being returned at each step
3. **Check for variable shadowing**: Ensure 'results' isn't being reassigned after filtering
4. **Test with smaller datasets**: Use top_k=10 to make it easier to track individual results

## Current Status

- **Enhanced Variable Picker**: ✅ Working perfectly
- **Similarity Filtering**: 
  - ✅ Code executes
  - ✅ Filtering logic works
  - ❌ Filtered results not returned to client

The filtering logic is sound and executing, but there's a bug in how the filtered results are propagated back to the API response.
