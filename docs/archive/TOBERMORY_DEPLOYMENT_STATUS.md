# Tobermory.ai Deployment Status

## Current Status: üü¢ SSL Active! Production Deployment In Progress

### ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

1. **Frontend Deployment**
   - React app successfully built and deployed
   - Static file serving configured correctly
   - Accessible at: https://feisty-catcher-461000-g2.nn.r.appspot.com

2. **Backend API**
   - Deployed with lazy loading for embeddings
   - Health endpoint: `/health`
   - NL processing endpoint: `/api/nl/process`
   - CORS configured for all origins

3. **Embeddings Storage**
   - Created GCS bucket: `activation-manager-embeddings`
   - Uploaded all embedding files (382MB total)
   - Implemented lazy loading to avoid timeouts
   - Embeddings loading in background on first request

4. **Domain Configuration**
   - Domain mapping created for tobermory.ai
   - DNS A records configured in Cloudflare ‚úì
   - All 4 required IPs added
   - Proxy status set to "DNS only" ‚úì

### ‚úÖ SSL Certificate ACTIVE!
   - Certificate ID: 42498138
   - Status: OK/ACTIVE
   - Domain verified and certificate issued
   - HTTPS should be working (may need a few minutes for propagation)

### üü° In Progress

1. **Production Optimization Deployment**
   - Deploying version with caching and compression
   - Better performance and resource utilization
   - Version: 20250527t220034

### ‚è≥ Waiting For

1. **SSL Certificate Activation**
   - Once activated, https://tobermory.ai will work
   - HTTP will automatically redirect to HTTPS

2. **Embeddings Loading**
   - 283MB numpy file downloading in background
   - Currently using keyword search fallback
   - Will automatically switch to semantic search when ready

### üîÑ Next Steps

1. Wait for SSL certificate to activate (check every 10-15 minutes)
2. Once SSL is active, verify https://tobermory.ai works
3. Test the application functionality
4. Monitor embeddings loading completion

### üìä Quick Status Checks

```bash
# Check SSL certificate status
gcloud app ssl-certificates describe 42498138 --project=feisty-catcher-461000-g2

# Check if site is accessible
curl -I https://tobermory.ai

# Check embeddings status
curl https://feisty-catcher-461000-g2.nn.r.appspot.com/health
```
