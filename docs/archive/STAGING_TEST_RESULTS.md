# Staging Test Results - Fixed Deployment

**URL**: https://stg-20250530-095613-dot-feisty-catcher-461000-g2.appspot.com  
**Version**: stg-20250530-095613  
**Date**: 2025-05-30

## Test Summary

### ✅ Working Features:

1. **Frontend** 
   - Loading correctly
   - All assets (CSS, JS) loading properly
   - React app initializing successfully

2. **Enhanced Variable Picker API**
   - ✅ Search functionality working
   - ✅ Returns results for keyword searches
   - ✅ Fast response times after initial warmup (0.69s for cached queries)
   - ✅ First search takes ~18-28 seconds (loading embeddings)

3. **API Health Check**
   - ✅ `/api/health` endpoint working
   - Returns proper health status

### ⚠️ Issues to Address:

1. **Audience APIs (503 errors)**
   - `/api/audiences` endpoint returning 503
   - Audience creation failing
   - Need to investigate audience handler initialization

2. **Initial Load Time**
   - First variable search takes 18-28 seconds
   - This is due to FAISS embeddings loading
   - Subsequent searches are fast (<1s)

## Key Improvements Made:

1. **Fixed Startup Issues**:
   - Removed synchronous pre-warming during startup
   - Implemented lazy loading for Enhanced Variable Picker
   - Fixed duplicate function names (health_check)
   - Added proper warmup handler

2. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Lazy initialization of heavy components
   - Proper error handling for embeddings loading
   - Added readiness check configuration

## Manual Testing Checklist:

### Frontend Features:
- [ ] Navigate to `/audiences` - Check if page loads
- [ ] Click "Create New Audience" button
- [ ] Test Manual Builder mode:
  - [ ] Variable selector shows "Search 49,000+ variables..." placeholder
  - [ ] Search for "income" - verify results appear
  - [ ] Check performance indicator (lightning bolt) at bottom
  - [ ] Verify smooth scrolling with virtualization
- [ ] Test Natural Language mode switch
- [ ] Check for any console errors in browser DevTools

### Backend Features:
- [x] Variable search API working
- [x] Health check API working
- [ ] Audience CRUD operations (currently failing)

## Next Steps:

1. Fix audience API 503 errors
2. Implement better error handling for audience endpoints
3. Consider pre-loading embeddings in background after startup
4. Add monitoring for slow endpoints
