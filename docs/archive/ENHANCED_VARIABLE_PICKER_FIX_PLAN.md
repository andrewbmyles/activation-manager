# Enhanced Variable Picker Fix Plan

## Problem Summary
The enhanced variable picker deployment is failing with 500 errors due to:
1. Missing error handling in new API routes
2. Assumptions about data availability that fail in production
3. DataFrame operations that crash when data isn't loaded

## Solution Approach

### Phase 1: Defensive Coding (COMPLETED âœ…)
- Added try-catch blocks to all new endpoints
- Added fallback behavior when enhanced features aren't available
- Return graceful errors instead of 500s
- Added detailed logging with exc_info=True

### Phase 2: Deploy Fixed Version
```bash
# Deploy with enhanced logging
./deploy-fix-variable-picker-routes.sh
```

### Phase 3: Verify Fixes
1. Test health endpoint first
2. Test each variable picker endpoint
3. Verify fallback behavior works
4. Check logs for specific errors

### Phase 4: Incremental Enhancement
Once basic functionality is working:
1. Fix specific issues found in logs
2. Optimize performance
3. Add caching layer
4. Enable full enhanced features

## Key Changes Made

### 1. GET /api/variable-picker/search
- Added error handling for enhanced picker
- Falls back to basic search
- Returns detailed error messages

### 2. GET /api/variable-picker/categories
- Multiple fallback sources for categories
- Returns default categories if all else fails
- Always returns 200 with data

### 3. GET /api/variable-picker/category/<category>
- Safe DataFrame access with checks
- Fallback to VARIABLE_DATABASE
- Returns empty list instead of 500

### 4. POST /api/variable-picker/search/complex
- Nested try-catch for enhanced and basic search
- Always returns valid response structure
- Includes method used in response

### 5. POST /api/variable-picker/refine
- Graceful degradation when enhanced picker unavailable
- Clear messaging about fallback mode
- Always returns valid response

## Next Steps

1. Deploy the fixed version
2. Run comprehensive tests
3. Monitor logs for remaining issues
4. Fix any specific errors found
5. Gradually enable enhanced features

## Success Criteria

- All endpoints return 200/201 (not 500)
- Basic functionality works even without enhanced features
- Clear error messages in logs
- Graceful degradation when components fail
- Frontend continues to work with fallback responses
