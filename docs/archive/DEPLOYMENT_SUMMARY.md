# Tobermory.ai Deployment Summary

## Status: ðŸŸ¢ Nearly Complete!

### What's Working:
1. âœ… **Frontend deployed** - React app serving correctly
2. âœ… **Backend API functional** - Health check and NL processing endpoints working
3. âœ… **Domain DNS configured** - tobermory.ai pointing to Google App Engine
4. âœ… **SSL Certificate ACTIVE** - HTTPS is now enabled
5. âœ… **CORS configured** - Ready for cross-origin requests

### What's In Progress:
1. ðŸŸ¡ **Embeddings Loading** - 283MB file still downloading (using keyword search fallback)
2. ðŸŸ¡ **Production Deployment** - Deploying optimized version with caching

### Production Optimizations Deployed:
- **Response Caching**: Frequently asked queries are cached for 1 hour
- **Gzip Compression**: All responses are compressed
- **Optimized Static Assets**: 30-day cache for JS/CSS files
- **Security Headers**: Added X-Frame-Options, CSP, etc.
- **Better Scaling**: Min 1 instance, max 10 with auto-scaling

### Quick Commands:
```bash
# Check if tobermory.ai is accessible
curl -I https://tobermory.ai

# Check embeddings status
curl https://feisty-catcher-461000-g2.nn.r.appspot.com/health

# Test semantic search
curl -X POST https://tobermory.ai/api/nl/process \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "millennials in urban areas"}'
```

### Next Steps:
1. Wait for embeddings to finish loading (check health endpoint)
2. Verify tobermory.ai is accessible via HTTPS
3. Test the application functionality
4. Monitor performance and logs
