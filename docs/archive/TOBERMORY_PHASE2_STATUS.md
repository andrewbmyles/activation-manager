# Tobermory.ai Deployment - Phase 2 Status

## Phase 2: Cloud Storage for Embeddings ✅ PARTIALLY COMPLETE

### Accomplishments:

#### ✅ Successfully Completed:
1. **Created GCS Bucket**
   - Bucket: `gs://activation-manager-embeddings`
   - Location: us-central1
   - Permissions: App Engine service account has objectViewer role

2. **Uploaded All Embedding Files**
   - ✅ `variable_embeddings_full.npy` (283.2 MB)
   - ✅ `all_variable_embeddings.parquet` (66.58 MB)
   - ✅ `variable_vectors_enhanced.parquet` (583 KB)
   - ✅ `variable_vectors.parquet` (113 KB)
   - ✅ All metadata files (JSON/JSONL)
   - **Total**: 382.46 MB across 10 files

3. **Backend Code Updated**
   - Created `backend_gcs_enhanced.py` with GCS loading capability
   - Added proper error handling and fallback
   - Integrated with existing variable_selector

#### ⚠️ Issue Encountered:
- Backend initialization timeout when loading from GCS
- Likely due to cold start + large file download (283MB)
- App Engine has a 60-second startup timeout

### Current Status:
- Frontend: ✅ Working
- API: ✅ Working (with local data)
- GCS: ✅ Files uploaded and accessible
- Backend Integration: ⚠️ Timeout issues

### Solutions to Implement:

1. **Option A: Lazy Loading** (Recommended)
   - Load embeddings on first request, not startup
   - Cache in memory after loading
   - Faster startup times

2. **Option B: Use Smaller Embeddings**
   - Use only the parquet files (67MB)
   - Trade some accuracy for speed

3. **Option C: Increase Instance Class**
   - Use F4 instance for more memory/CPU
   - May still hit timeout

### Files Created/Modified:
- ✅ Created GCS bucket
- ✅ Uploaded 10 embedding files
- ✅ Created `backend_gcs_enhanced.py`
- ✅ Updated `main.py` (reverted for now)
- ✅ Updated `app_tobermory.yaml` with GCS config

### Next Steps:
1. Implement lazy loading for embeddings
2. Add warmup request handler
3. Consider using Cloud Run for longer timeouts
4. Test with smaller dataset first

## Time Tracking:
- Phase 2 Start: 20:45
- Phase 2 Current: 21:00
- **Duration So Far**: 15 minutes
- **Status**: Need to resolve timeout issue

## Recommendation:
Continue with Phase 3 (Custom Domain) while we optimize the GCS loading in parallel. The embeddings are successfully in cloud storage and can be integrated once we resolve the timeout issue.
