# Staging Filter Issue Analysis

## Current Status

The enhanced similarity filtering with base pattern grouping is **NOT working in staging**.

### Evidence

When searching for "contact with friends income":
- **Expected**: 2 or fewer "Contact with friends [Pst Mth]" variations
- **Actual**: 43 variations (no filtering applied)

### Staging URLs Tested
1. `enhanced-filter-20250530-134221-dot-feisty-catcher-461000-g2.nn.r.appspot.com`
2. `stg-filtering-20250530-131431-dot-feisty-catcher-461000-g2.nn.r.appspot.com`

Both show the same issue - filtering is not being applied.

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Code Status
- ✅ Enhanced `_filter_similar_variables()` method implemented
- ✅ Base pattern extraction logic added
- ✅ Aggressive filtering threshold (0.75) for groups
- ✅ Code committed to git (commit: af23e50)
- ✅ Local tests pass (7 → 1 Contact with friends)

### 2. Deployment Issues
- The staging deployments may not include the latest code
- Possible caching issue with Google App Engine
- The filtering method may not be called in the deployed version

### 3. Code Path Issues
- When `filter_similar=True` is passed, the code should call `_filter_similar_variables()`
- The method exists in the code but isn't being executed in staging

## Next Steps

1. **Verify Code Deployment**
   - Check if the deployed files actually contain the enhanced filtering code
   - Look for deployment caching issues

2. **Add Logging**
   - Add explicit logging to `_filter_similar_variables()` to confirm it's being called
   - Check App Engine logs for any errors

3. **Force Fresh Deployment**
   - Deploy with `--no-cache` flag
   - Use a completely new version ID
   - Verify the deployment includes all recent changes

4. **Alternative Approach**
   - Consider implementing filtering at a different layer (API level)
   - Add a post-processing step that always filters results

## Workaround

Until the staging issue is resolved, the filtering can be tested locally where it works correctly.
