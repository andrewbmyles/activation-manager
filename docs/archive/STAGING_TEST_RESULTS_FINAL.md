# Staging Test Results - Final Report

## Deployment Information

- **Version**: `stg-complete-20250530-143414`
- **URL**: https://stg-complete-20250530-143414-dot-feisty-catcher-461000-g2.nn.r.appspot.com
- **Deployed**: May 30, 2025 at 14:34
- **Status**: Active

## Enhancement 1: Enhanced Variable Picker ✅ WORKING

### Test Results
- **Query**: "young affluent urban professionals"
- **Results**: 50 (maximum requested)
- **Advanced Processing**: ✅ Working
- **Concept Understanding**: ✅ Working
  - Found 2 concepts: "income level" (financial), "urban" (geographic)
- **Semantic Search**: ✅ Working
- **Performance**: Good (response time < 2 seconds)

### Features Confirmed Working:
1. Returns up to 50 results as designed
2. Advanced query processing with concept extraction
3. Semantic understanding of complex queries
4. Proper integration with existing search infrastructure

## Enhancement 2: Similarity Filtering ❌ NOT WORKING

### Test Results
- **Query**: "contact with friends income"
- **Expected**: ≤2 variations per base pattern
- **Actual**: 43 variations of "Contact with friends [Pst Mth]"
- **Status**: Filtering is NOT being applied

### Issue Details:
- The base pattern grouping logic exists in the code
- Works perfectly in local testing (7 → 1 variations)
- Not executing in the staging deployment
- All 43 "Contact with friends" variations are still being returned

### Root Cause Analysis:
1. Code is committed and deployed
2. Enhancement 1 is working, proving the deployment succeeded
3. The filtering method may not be called in the code path
4. Possible issue with how parameters are passed through the API layers

## Combined Features Test

When both features are enabled:
- Enhanced search: ✅ Working
- Similarity filtering: ❌ Not working
- No conflicts between features
- Results: 30 (but should be fewer with filtering)

## UI Test URLs

You can test the features in the UI:

1. **Variable Picker**:

2. **Audience Builder**:

## API Test Examples

### Enhanced Search (Working):
```bash
curl -X POST https://stg-complete-20250530-143414-dot-feisty-catcher-461000-g2.nn.r.appspot.com/api/enhanced-variable-picker/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "young affluent urban professionals",
    "top_k": 50,
    "use_advanced_processing": true
  }'
```

### Similarity Filtering (Not Working):
```bash
curl -X POST https://stg-complete-20250530-143414-dot-feisty-catcher-461000-g2.nn.r.appspot.com/api/enhanced-variable-picker/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "contact with friends income",
    "top_k": 50,
    "filter_similar": true,
    "similarity_threshold": 0.75,
    "max_similar_per_group": 2
  }'
```

## Summary

1. **Enhanced Variable Picker**: ✅ Ready for production
   - All features working as designed
   - Good performance
   - Proper concept understanding

2. **Similarity Filtering**: ❌ Needs investigation
   - Code is implemented correctly
   - Works in local testing
   - Not executing in staging deployment
   - Requires debugging to identify why the filtering isn't being applied

## Recommendations

1. **For Enhanced Variable Picker**: Can be promoted to production
2. **For Similarity Filtering**: Needs additional debugging before production
   - Add explicit logging to trace execution
   - Verify parameter passing through all layers
   - Consider alternative implementation approach if needed
